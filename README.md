## Playlist selection ...
... is done in a hierarchical fashion, depending on directory hierarchy on disk as seen by the OwnTone server.</br>
On each level of the hierararchy, only entries with a leading pair of digits, followed with an underscore, will be considered.</br>
The leading pair of digits is used for sorting purposes, and removed for display.</br>

## Sleep timer ...
... functionality will fade out playback after a selectable amount of time.</br>
NOTE: For the sleep timer to work, it is necessary to go to the app's "App Info" dialog in preferences, and allow 
"Alarms & reminders" for the app. Otherwise, sleep timers will fail to register with the Android system.
